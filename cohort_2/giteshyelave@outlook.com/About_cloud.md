# Disaster Recovery :-

![](https://www.ironmountain.com/-/media/images/Iron-Mountain/Resources/Multimedia/i/iron-cloud-disaster-recovery-service-cloud-with-technology-symbols-dangling-from-it.jpg)

- Cloud disaster recovery typically provides similar services as an on-premises or company-maintained off-premises disaster recovery plan (DRP) facility, but in an economical, efficient and provider-managed platform.

- A cloud DRP vendor provisions users and storage space and continuously update designated systems with client software installed on each system.

- Users have the ability to add, edit and delete systems and storage capacity, without having to consider the back-end supported infrastructure.

- A cloud-based disaster recovery solution enables the user to scale up the entire cloud DRP solution from some-to-many. The user is normally billed on a monthly basis only for the storage and client software licenses. 

- Most Cloud DR also provisions backup and recovery for critical server machines that host enterprise-level applications like MS-SQL, Oracle, etc

### How does disaster recovery in cloud computing differ from traditional disaster recovery ?

##### Ans.

- Traditional disaster recovery involves building a remote disaster recovery (DR) site, which requires constant maintenance and support on your part. In this case, data protection and disaster recovery are performed manually, which can be a time-consuming and resource-intensive process. 

- Disaster recovery in cloud computing entails storing critical data and applications in cloud storage and failing over to a secondary site in case of a disaster. Cloud computing services are provided on a pay-as-you-go basis and can be accessed from anywhere and at any time. Backup and disaster recovery in cloud computing can be automated, requiring minimum input on your part.

### How does disaster recovery planning work in cloud computing?

##### Ans.

- Creating, testing, and updating a DR plan can prepare your organization for an unexpected disaster and ensure safety and continuity for your business. A comprehensive DR plan should take into account your infrastructure, potential threats and vulnerabilities, most critical assets and the order of their recovery, and workable DR strategies.

- Integration of cloud computing services in disaster recovery allows you to design a DR plan and automate each step of the recovery process.

## Cloud disaster recovery vs. traditional disaster recovery

The essential element of traditional disaster recovery is a secondary data center, which can store all redundant copies of critical data, and to which you can fail over production workloads. A traditional on-premises DR site generally includes the following:

- A dedicated facility for housing the IT infrastructure, including maintenance employees and computing equipment.

- Sufficient server capacity to ensure a high level of operational performance and allow the data center to scale up or scale out depending on your business needs.

- Internet connectivity with sufficient bandwidth to enable remote access to the secondary data center.

- Network infrastructure, including firewalls, routers, and switches, to ensure a reliable connection between the primaryand secondary data centers, as well as provide data availability.

###### However, traditional disaster recovery can often be too complex to manage and monitor.

Disaster recovery in cloud computing can effectively deal with most issues of traditional disaster recovery. The benefits include the following:

- You don’t need to build a secondary physical site, and buy additional hardware and software to support critical operations. With disaster recovery in cloud computing, you get access to cloud storage, which can be used as a secondary DR site.

- Depending on your current business demands, you can easily scale up or down by adding required cloud computing resources.

- With its affordable pay-as-you go pricing model, you are required to pay only for the cloud computing services you actually use.

- Disaster recovery in cloud computing can be performed in a matter of minutes from anywhere. The only thing you need is a device that is connected to the internet.

## Benefits of cloud DR :-

1. High-reliability and geo-redundancy :-)  
          One essential hallmark of a cloud provider is a global footprint, ensuring multiple data centers to support users across major global geopolitical regions. Cloud providers use this to improve service reliability and ensure redundancy.

2. Easy testing and fast recovery :-)  
          Cloud workloads routinely operate with VMs, making it easy to copy VM image files to in-house test servers to validate workload availability without affecting production workloads

# What is Capital expenditure (CapEx) ?

![](https://www.softwareadvisoryservice.com/media/2417/what-is-capex.png)

##### Ans. 

- A capital expenditure is incurred when a business spends money, uses collateral, or takes on debt to either buy a new asset or add to the value of an existing asset with the expectation of receiving benefits for longer than a single tax year. Essentially, a capital expenditure represents an investment in the business.

- Capital expenses are recorded as assets on a company's balance sheet rather than as expenses on the income statement. The asset is then depreciated over the total life of the asset, with a period depreciation expense charged to the company's income statement, normally monthly.

- Accumulated depreciation is recorded on the company's balance sheet as the summation of all depreciation expenses, and it reduces the value of the asset over the life of that asset.

- Examples of capital expenses include the purchase of fixed assets, such as new buildings or business equipment, upgrades to existing facilities, and the acquisition of intangible assets, such as patents.

# What is Operational expenditure (OpeEx)?

##### Ans.

- Operating expenses are expenses incurred during regular business, such as general and administrative expenses, research and development, and the cost of goods sold.

- Operating expenses are much easier to understand conceptually than capital expenses since they are part of the day-to-day operations. All operating expenses are recorded on a company's income statement as expenses in the period when they were incurred.

- Operating expenses include a wide range of expense types, from office supplies and travel and distribution expenses to licensing fees, utilities, property insurance, and property taxes.

-  If equipment is leased instead of purchased, it is typically considered an operating expense. General repairs and maintenance of existing fixed assets such as buildings and equipment are also considered operating expenses unless the improvements will increase the useful life of the asset.

- This can be a financially attractive option for the company if the company has limited cash flow.

# Capex, Opex and the Cloud

- There are three popular types of Cloud computing: private, public, and hybrid. Understanding Capex and Opex is instrumental in recognising the differences between the different types of Clouds.

- With the public Cloud, the service provider is the one making the Capex, so that their users can buy in an Opex or pay as you go model.

- A private Cloud involves an organisation’s IT team doing the Capex, so that users or business units within a company will be able to consume the resources in an Opex or pay as you go model.

- Businesses can use resources from both private and public Clouds, which becomes a hybrid Cloud. A hybrid Cloud can be managed by a single solution. If the buyer of the public Cloud is your IT team, then the hybrid Cloud essentially becomes a combination of Capex and Opex models. This gives businesses better flexibility to control their costs.

- Cloud Services are fast becoming the norm for any modern business. However, there are so many solutions available that spending time finding the right system for you can cost your business a significant amount of time and money, and runs the risk of you implementing a solution that isn’t ideal.
